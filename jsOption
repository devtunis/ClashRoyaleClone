# My Tiled + JavaScript Game Project

## Overview
This is a simple game project made with **Tiled Map Editor** and **JavaScript**.  
The project is designed to experiment with **Tiles, Layers, and Objects** like enemies, obstacles, and ground tiles.  

---

## Features
- **Tiled Map Support:** Import `.json` maps exported from Tiled.
- **Multiple Layers:**  
  - Ground Layer (tiles like grass, sand, water)  
  - Obstacle Layer (walls, rocks, trees)  
  - Enemy Layer (objects with x, y coordinates)  
  - Optional Layers (effects, tree tops)
- **JavaScript Rendering:** Draws tiles, obstacles, and objects using Canvas.
- **Expandable:** Easy to add new layers, tiles, or enemies.

## How it Works
1. Design your map in **Tiled**.  
2. Export the map as **JSON**.  
3. Load the JSON in JavaScript:  

```javascript
fetch("map.json")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(map => {
    // Loop through layers and draw tiles
  });
